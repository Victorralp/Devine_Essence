              <p>
                Divine Essence was born out of a deep personal journey toward spiritual
                awakening and holistic wellness. Our founder, after experiencing the
                transformative power of natural remedies and spiritual practices, committed
                to creating a sanctuary where others could discover tools for their own
                spiritual journeys.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a small collection of handcrafted items has grown into a
                thoughtfully curated selection of products sourced from artisans who share
                our commitment to quality, sustainability, and spiritual integrity.

                in mind.
